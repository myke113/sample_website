# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [_Learn Enough HTML to Be
Dangerous_](https://www.learnenough.com/course/learn_enough_html/), possibly the greatest
beginner HTML tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [
check it out](https://www.learnenough.com/course/learn_enough_html/), and be sure to [join
the email list](https://www.learnenough.com/#email_list) and
[follow @learnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing _Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous_, you'll know enough HTML
to be _dangerous_. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in
your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate
with programmers and other users of Git.

For more information on HTML, see the
[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) (To be fixed later)
